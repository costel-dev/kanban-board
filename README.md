# Kanban Board Project

## Description

    The main goal of this project is to showcase Drag&Drop API. Being a devoted user of Trello Board I allways was amazed about the magic behind it, and in order to keep track of all my tasks and projects I allways wanted to build my own Kanban Board.
    Things that I tackle in this project:

- CRUD Operations(Create, Read, Update, Delete)
- Drag and Drop Cards inside of the Kanban Board
- Set/Get Items in/from localStorage
